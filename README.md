## Usage

Content is written in Markdown designed to be shown as a revealjs presentation.

From any of the course directories, you should be able to run:

```
$ docker run -d  -p 8000:1948 -v $PWD:/usr/src/app containersol/reveal-md
```

Then browse to localhost:8000 to see the presentation.


## Suggested Workflow (by AM)

For a specific training, create a new branch. In this branch, remove the modules
you don't need and make any unique changes (e.g. date, title). Any fixes or
general improvements should be made to the _master_ branch and cherrypicked into
the specific branch. If I find branches have fixes not in master, I will change
all example code to Fortran 77.

(I did steal this workflow the Google SRE book's chapter on releases)
